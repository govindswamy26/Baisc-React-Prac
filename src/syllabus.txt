useState :

1...The useState hook in React is a fundamental tool that enables functional components to manage and update their internal state.
2...It allows you to introduce state variables into functional components, which were previously only available in class components.
Here's how useState works:
a...Importing useState: You need to import useState from the react library at the top of your component file:
JavaScript

*** import React, { useState } from 'react';

b...Declaring a State Variable: Inside your functional component, you call useState to declare a state variable. It takes one argument: the initial value of your state variable. It returns an array containing two elements:
The current state value.
A setter function to update that state value.
You typically use array destructuring to extract these two elements:
JavaScript

*** const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
In this example, count is the state variable initialized to 0, and setCount is the function used to update count.
Updating the State: To modify the state variable, you call its corresponding setter function, passing the new value as an argument. When the setter function is called, React re-renders the component with the updated state.
JavaScript

    setCount(count + 1); // Increments the count

Using the State: You can use the state variable directly within your JSX to display its value or incorporate it into your component's logic.
JavaScript

    <p>You clicked {count} times</p>

### Key Points about useState:
 Functional Components:
1...useState is designed for use within functional components, allowing them to become stateful.

2...Immutability:
When updating state, it's crucial to create a new value rather than directly modifying the existing one, especially for objects and arrays, to ensure React detects the change and re-renders correctly.

3...Initial State:
The initial value provided to useState is only used during the first render of the component. Subsequent re-renders will use the current state value, not re-initialize it.

4...Setter Function for Previous State:
If your new state depends on the previous state, you can pass a function to the setter, which receives the previous state as an argument:
*** setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);

üìò Destructuring in React: [ ] vs { }

1. [ ] ‚Üí Array Destructuring
   - Used when destructuring arrays
   - Example:
     const [a, b] = [10, 20];          // a = 10, b = 20
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // React Hook returns array

2. { } ‚Üí Object Destructuring
   - Used when destructuring objects
   - Example:
     const { name, age } = { name: 'Govind', age: 21 };
     function Profile({ name, age }) {
       return <div>{name} - {age}</div>;
     }

3. Special Case: useEffect Dependencies
   - Always use [ ] as it's an array of dependencies:
     useEffect(() => { ... }, [count]);

| Symbol | Use Case             | Example                             |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [ ]    | Array Destructuring  | const [a, b] = arr                  |
| { }    | Object Destructuring | const {x, y} = obj                  |
