// 🔰 Basic Level

1. Create a component with an input field and a button. On button click, focus the input using useRef.
2. Track how many times a component has rendered using useRef.
3. Show previous value of a state variable using useRef.
4. Create a countdown timer and store interval ID using useRef, then clear it on unmount.
5. Build a stop-watch that starts/stops on button click using useRef for interval tracking.


// 🧩 Intermediate Level

6. Create a component that detects whether a user is typing (add “Typing…” message while typing, hide after 2s of inactivity).
7. Create a form with validation and store each input's validity using refs.
8. Prevent re-renders of a counter by using useRef instead of useState.
9. Implement a custom hook usePrevious using useRef to track previous state.
10. Build a modal that traps focus using useRef and DOM manipulation.


// ⚙️ Advanced + Practical UI Scenarios

11. Create an animated input field that focuses when a modal opens (simulate modal behavior).
12. Build a to-do app where each to-do item has a `useRef` for managing direct input edits.
13. Use useRef to create a scroll-to-section feature (scroll to a specific div on button click).
14. Detect clicks outside of a dropdown or modal using useRef and event listeners.
15. Track how long a component has been mounted (in seconds) using useRef and setInterval.
